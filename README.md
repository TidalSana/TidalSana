### Joshua Semana â€”â€” @TidalSana
Hi, my name is Joshua Semana! This is where I web-dev/design stuff when I have the time. I'm hoping to turn it into a career at some point. Currently, I'm majoring in Computer Science (Networking) at the University of Providence. Also, I'm an entry level Networking intern at a Medical Billing Company. In my free time I enjoy either building mechanical Keyboards or playing video games. 

### Where I'm from

I'm from a tiny southern Pacific island called Rota. Have you ever heard of the Marianas Trench? It's about 40 miles from there! It's also one of the neighboring islands to Guam (I was born there).

### Experience
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- C++

In addition, I have experience with Active Directory (AD), Group Policy Objects (GPO), DHCP, Subnetting, IP addressing and light scripting. I'm also experienced in building computers, flashing Motherboard bios, setting up physical network devices, PBX phones, virtual networks, VPN and most things IT related.

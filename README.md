    <p>  üòÅ Hi, my name is Joshua Semana!  I try to do a lot of web dev/designer stuff when I have the time. I'm hoping to turn it into a career at some point. Currently, I'm entry level Network Administrator and I'm also majoring in Computer Science Networking at the University of Providence. In my free time I enjoy either tinkering with my keyboards or playing video games. I'm currently an part-time/intern for a Medial Billing Company.

<div class="About">
  <h2> What's being done? </h2>
    <p>
I'm applying things I've learned from my early years in college. I'm a little rough around the edges and I wouldn't even consider myself a professional web developer, but I'm willing to grow and learn as much as I can. 
    </p> 
</div>

<div class="Experience"> 
  <h1> Experience </h1>
    <p>
Right now, I'm learning modern frameworks like <b>Bootstrap</b>, <b>Angular</b>, <b>React</b> and <b>VUE</b>. As well as languages like PHP and older things like Jquery. 
    </p>
  <p> Languages I know include:
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item"> HTML</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> CSS </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> Java </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> Javascript </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> Python </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"> C++ </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
In addition, I have experience with back end work due to my networking experience, Active Directory (AD), Group Policy Objects (GPO), DHDCP, Subnetting, IP addressing and light scripting. I'm also experienced in building computers, flashing Motherboard bios, setting up physical network devices, PBX phones, virtual networks and VPNs.

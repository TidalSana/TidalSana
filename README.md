### Where am I from? :confused:

I'm from a tiny southern Pacific island called Rota. Have you ever heard of the Marianas Trench, it's about 40 miles from there. It's also one of the neighboring islands to Guam (I was born there).

<!-- ### School - eSports? :video_game:
I recently graduated from The University of Providence Great Falls at the end of 2021. I originally started at GFCMSU (Great Falls College MSU) and was looking to transfer to a 4-year university. Luckily, I ended up being picked for an eSports scholarship by the local university. I ended up staying for the rest of my college career and receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

##### More about eSports (It's a long story...)

_Well what about that esports thang??? Joshua?_

For those interested, I ended up [receiving a position](https://upargos.com/news/2019/1/21/argo-esports-inks-semana-to-league-spring-roster.aspx) on the team to play League of Legends (wooo!). For those who know league, it is a very difficult game. I would say mechanics matter (pressing buttons pretty fast), but game knowledge (knowing stuff) outshines. Of course, both together play a big role in how a player is in-game. I played mid and I ended up playing throughout my entire college career. I wanted to make a career out of it, but things don't always go as planned (I still love programming btw!). Even before I joined the team and enrolled in university, I was pretty committed to playing league, I made schedules, game plans, notes, and timelines of how I would improve over time, hopefully reaching my goal of becoming a pro player.

I learned a lot and one key takeaway from playing League was if I wanted to improve, I had to accept that I'm not perfect and point out my mistakes and improve upon them. eSports in college and even up to this day, helping out friends and coaching teammates was very difficult. Even I catch myself blaming other people, the environment, and everything, but myself. I now know that you can't pin the blame on anything other than yourself. Not just for league, but everything in life, yes it is very nice to get assistance from friends and family, but it starts with the person. -->

### Joshua Semana —— @TidalSana
>😁 Hi, my name is Joshua Semana! This is where I web-dev/design stuff when I have the time. I'm hoping to turn it into a career at some point. Currently, I'm majoring in Computer Science Networking at the University of Providence. Also, I'm an entry level intern at a Medical Billing Company. In my free time I enjoy either building mechanical Keyboards or playing video games.

### Where I'm from
>
>I'm from a southern Pacific island called Rota. Have you ever heard of the Marianas Trench 🤔? It's about 40 miles from there! It's also one of the neighboring islands to Guam (I was born there).
